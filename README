So, I think that the gitpet should be associated with your profile. You should be able to gain points when you commit or finish projects or something like that. You have to commit to feed your pet and keep it alive. Like, its source of life/sustenance is your commit activity. Is there a way to see how big your commit is? Like, if you did a lot it should be worth more points or something. So you should keep your pet alive with commits. And maybe it can level up too? Then with points you should be able to purchase cute shit for your pet like gitpetpets or clothes or accessories and toys and stuff. You should be able to play with other gitpets or battle or some sort of interaction with other people's gitpets but maybe that can come later. I'm also okay with just hanging out with my own gitpet by myself. 
Or instead of feeding we can have a happiness meter? Like, if you commit, it's like playing with your pet and making it happier. And when it's happy it can level up and stuff. And then when it's happy it can leave you gifts? Or maybe repos will randomly drop stuff when you commit to them, and then those drops can be given to your pet.
Okay, yeah, decisions are hard.
